// In JavaScript, lexical scope refers to the scope resolution that is based solely on the location of a variable declaration within the source code, also known as the lexical environment. In other words, the scope of a variable is determined by where it is defined in the code, and this scope is fixed at the time of the variable's creation.

// A closure is created when a function "closes over" its surrounding lexical environment, retaining access to variables and functions defined in that environment, even after that environment is no longer active. This allows the function to access variables from its parent scope, even if that scope has already returned and been destroyed.

// In other words, a closure is a function that has access to variables in its lexical scope, even after the scope has been destroyed, because the closure retains a reference to those variables.

// In practical terms, closures are often used to create private variables and methods in JavaScript, as well as to implement callback functions and other programming patterns that require preserving state between function calls.
